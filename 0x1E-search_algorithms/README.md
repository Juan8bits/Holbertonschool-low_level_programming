###[0. Linear Search](./0-linear.c)
Function that searches for a valie in an array of integers using the Linear Search Algorithm.

###[1. Binary Search](./1-binary.c)
Function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary Search Algorithm.

###[2. Big O notation 0 to 4]
Some Time and Space Complexity definitions (worst case) for specific cases:
*   Linear search in an array of size n. (Time)
*   Iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n. (Space)
*   Binary search in an array of size n. (Time)
*   Binary search in an array of size n. (Space)
*   Specific block funtion. (Space)
