## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* Look for the right source of information without too much help
* How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

### [0. 0](./0-binary_to_uint.c)
* Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.


### [1. 1](./1-print_binary.c)
* Function that prints the binary representation of a number.


### [2. 10](./2-get_bit.c)
* Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.


### [3. 11](./3-set_bit.c)
* Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.


### [4. 100](./4-clear_bit.c)
* Function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.


### [5. 101](./5-flip_bits.c)
* Function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

### [6. Endianness](./100-get_endianness.c)
* Function that checks the endianness.
